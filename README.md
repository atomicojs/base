### npm start

Create a development server on the `src` directory.

### npm run build

```bash
npm install -D @devserver/build
```

**This command only works if the package `@devserver/build` is previously installed**. Export all content associated with the expression `src/**/*.html`.

> If you export your project to a subfolder, be sure to use the `--href [path]` flag to declare that directory.
