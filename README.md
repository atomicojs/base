## frequent questions

### How to add postcss?

`@atomico/vite`, allows to preprocess the css template string through postcss, to use this feature add in vite.config.js the following options:

```js
import atomico from "@atomico/vite";
import { defineConfig } from "vite";

export default defineConfig({
  ...
  plugins: [
    atomico({
      cssLiterals: { postcss: true }, // ðŸ‘ˆ CONFIGURATION TO ADD
    }),
  ],
});
```

To use postcss at least 1 plugin is required.

```json
"postcss": {
  "plugins": {
    "postcss-import": {}
  }
}
```

### How to publish on github page?

Add to `package.json#scripts.build`:

```bash
--outDir docs # modify the destination directory
--base my-repo # github page folder
```
